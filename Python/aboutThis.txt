Lab2_EA is a lab for AI.
It's an Evolutionary Algorithm which solves this problem:

Consider a set A with n elements and S1 , S2 , ..., Sm subsets of A. Partitionate set
A in two disjoint subsets D1 and D2 so for all i = from 1 to n, Si is not included 
in either D1 or D2.

Lab2-PSO is a lab for AI.
It's an Particle Swarm Optimisation algorithm which solves this problem:

Consider an undirected graph G(V , E) with 2n nodes ( V is the set of nodes, and
E is the set of edges). Partitionate the set of nodes in two disjoint sets V 1 and V 2
, each
containing exactly n nodes, in such a way that between any two nodes of the subgraphs
determined by the subsets of nodes should be a path (both subgraphs are conex).
